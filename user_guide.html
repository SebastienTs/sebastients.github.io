                                  <p>TIFF images from an input folder are typically processed into object masks by applying a sequence of image analysis functions (workflow) configured in a journal (configuration file). The object masks can be of four kinds (see figure above):</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  	<li>Binary masks ('<b>Objs</b>'): objects encoded as connected groups of foreground pixels over 0 background</li>
									<li>Skeleton masks ('<b>Skls</b>'): 1-pixel curves tracing filament centrelines</li>
									<li>Seed masks ('<b>Spts</b>'): each foreground pixel (non zero) mark an object</li>
									<li>Label masks ('<b>Trks</b>'): objects encoded as connected groups of pixels (unique <b>ID</b>) over 0 background.</li>
								  </ul>
                                  </p>
								  
                                  <p><b>IRMA: Measuring objects</b></p>

								  <div class="screenshot-holder">
								    <img class="img-objmask" src="assets/images/ObjectMask.png" alt="screenshot" width="640">
				    			  </div>
								  
								  <p>
								  Object masks can be used to measure objects or as the building blocks of more complex workflows. For instance, <b>Object mask 1 </b>, is used to measure <b>C01</b> intensity <b>and</b> count the number of <b>C02</b> objects inside <b>C00</b> objects. Here <b>Object mask 2</b> is a seed mask where each identified spot is encoded as a foreground pixel. Objects masks can also be used for object based co-localization study (mask overlap is computed), or to extract relative object distance distributions, e.g. spots to filaments (distance transform is computed from skeleton mask and read at identified spot locations). All object measurements are performed from object masks by the module <b>IRMA</b>, and results are exported to <b>.csv</b> report files.

								  <p><b>JOSE/IRMA: Exporting object models</b></p>
								  <p>
                                  Identified objects can be exported as models: filaments networks are exported as <a href="http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html" target="_blank">SWC</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file" target="_blank">OBJ models</a>, object surfaces are exported as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)" target="_blank">STL meshes</a> and object tracks are exported as <b>SWC</b> trees or as <a href="https://imagej.net/Getting_started_with_MaMuT" target="_blank">Trackmate/Mamut/Mastodon tracks</a>. Finally, object markers can be exported as <b>CellInsight</b> files (<b>.xls</b>), an ImageJ macro (provided in <b>/Tools</b> folder) enabling to visualize, classify and edit 3D point clouds.

                                	The image analysis workflows used to identify objects are configured from <a href="file:///E:/LOBSTER_doc_git/sebastients.github.io/journals.html" target="_blank">journals</a>, human readable text files configuring input/output folders, the sequence of <b>LOBSTER</b> functions to apply to each input image and their associated parameters. Journals can be call from <b>LOBSTER Panel</b>, or directly from MATLAB console by typing <b>JENI</b>: </p>
                                  	<ul style="list-style: none;">
                                  	<li>>> <b>JENI</b>;</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
									When doing so, a file browser pops up. Select for instance the journal <font color="magenta">'Tissue_SegWaterTiles.jl'</font> from <b>/Journals/jl</b>, which identifies cells from cell-to-cell junction label. When launching a journal, every input image is displayed together with the results. Simply press <b>'x'</b> to proceed to the next image.</p>
									<p>You can tweak the parameters of a journal by editing in a text editor (e.g. Matlab editor): this is illustrated in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N9KWKvS52NMGZH0WiYF8bwJLZsvLFx6J/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
									<p>There are 3 kinds of journals with different extensions: 2D images (<b>.jl</b>), 3D images (<b>.jls</b>) and 2D/3D time-lapses (<b>.jm</b>).</p>

                                	<p><b>LOBSTER Panel</b> is probably the easiest way to get started, and almost all operations can be performed from this simple graphical user interface as long as no more than 2 journals are involved in a complete workflow.</p>
									<p> To start the <b>Panel</b>, type >> <b>LOBSTER</b> in MATLAB console. Up to 2 journals can be loaded and object measurements / exportation can be performed from the outputs of the journals.</p>
									<p>The most important items to configure first from the upper section of the <b>Panel</b> are (from left to right):</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li>Input images dimension (2D/3D)</li>
                                  <li>Whether object models should be exported or not</li>
                                  <li><b>ZRatio</b>, the ratio between slice spacing and pixel size (only relevant for 3D images).</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  
                                   <p>For the remaining items, refer to the context help provided when hovering over them.</p>
								   <p>The buttons on the right side are used to save/load a project and to cleanly exit the Panel.</p>
								   <p>To load a journal, click the button <b>Journal1</b> and select it from the file browser. For instance, load the 2D journal <font color="magenta">'Tissue_SegWaterTiles.jl'</font> used in the previous section. The input and output folders configured in the journal are automatically parsed and displayed in the fields <b>I</b> and <b>O</b>. These fields can also be set from a file browser by clicking <b>I1/I2/O1/O2</b>, or be manually edited. This is a convenient way to re-use journals to process different images.</p>

								  <div class="screenshot-holder">
								    	<img class="img-gui" src="assets/images/GUI.png" alt="screenshot" width="480">
				    			  </div>

                                  <p>To launch a journal, click the associated <b>Run</b> button. By default the journal is processed but nothing is shown (batch mode), this behaviour can be toggled from the button <b>Batch</b> located in the lower part of the <b>Panel</b>. If the results are not satisfactory, interrupt the journal by pressing <b>'q'</b>, edit its parameters by clicking associated <b>Edit</b> button, save the file (floppy disk or <b>Ctrl+S</b>) from MATLAB editor, and relaunch the journal. Once the results are satisfactory, toggle back to batch mode and launch the journal to process all images from the input folder.</p>
								  
								  <p>The input and output folders of a journal can be browsed by clicking <b>Show In</b> and <b>Show Out</b>.</p>

                                  <p>To perform measurements on the objects identified by <b>Journal1</b>, set the upper drop-down selector (object mask folder) to <b>O1</b> (that is, the output of <b>Journal 1</b>) and set the lower drop-down selector to '<b>Objs</b>' (plain objects measurements). Press <b>Run Measure 1</b>. Upon completion, press <b>Show Reports</b> to browse the folder holding the <b>.csv</b> reports.</p>

								  <p>It is possible to open an existing project by clicking <b>Load</b> button, for instance load the project <font color="magenta">'FISH.mat'</font>. This project loads two journals: the first journal identifies nuclei (DAPI channel) and the the second identifies FISH markers (as object seeds). The aim is to count the number of FISH markers inside every nucleus. Since both journals point to the same input folder, channel selection (DAPI/FISH) is performed inside the journals. To understand how, you can refer to <a href="journals.html" target="_blank">this page</a> to get more information about journals, but this is not strictly necessary at this point.</p>
								  
                                  <div class="screenshot-holder">
								    	<img class="img-gui2" src="assets/images/GUI2.png" alt="screenshot" width="480">
				    			  </div>

								  <p><b>Measure 1</b> is set to <b>O1</b> (nuclei mask) and the drop-down selector right below <b>O1</b> (channel folder) is set to <b>O2</b>, that is the output of <b>Journal2</b> (FISH seed mask). The bottom drop-down configures the intensity measurement channel, here used to count the number of FISH markers per nucleus (read from the report column <b>Number of non null pixels</b>).</p>
								  
								  <p>This is a special case to illustrate the use of two journals but regular object intensity measurements (e.g. from <b>I1</b>) can also be performed. If the images from channel to be measured hold the string <font color="magenta">'_C01'</font> in their file names, the channel filter (the field to the right of intensity measurement channel) should be set to <font color="magenta">'*_C01*.tif'</font> instead of the default <font color="magenta">'*.tif'</font>. This is for instance illustrated in the project <font color="magenta">'NucleiIntensityMeas.mat'</font>.</p>

								  <p>Finally, journal calls and measurements can be all triggered sequentially by pressing <b>Run All</b>. It is advised <b>not to interact with the Panel while an operation is performed</b>, this can be checked from the red color of the <b>Run All</b> button and from the log bar to the right.</p>

								  <p>Segmenting 2D objects from a time-lapse, tracking the objects, exploring results in ImageJ and plotting in Matlab.</p>
								  <p>Load project <font color="magenta">'HeLaTracking.mat'</font>. This project performs the segmentation and tracking of dividing nuclei from a sequence of 2D images. <b>TL</b> is enabled to specify that <b>Journal2</b> is a time-lapse journal perfroming tracking (.jlm extension).</p>
								  <p>This time, <b>I2</b> points to <b>O1</b> since the images are first segmented into object masks (Journal 1) before being tracked (Journal 2).</p>
								  <p>When running the first journal, an image window pops up at the end of the processing. This is because the tracker (Journal 2) requires the best possible segmentation mask at first time point. To this end, the user needs to correct erroneous object splitting (most common errors) by drawing small rectangles around false cut lines. Beware to maximize the image window (or zoom around), to make sure that all objects are properly merged. Exit mask correction by double clicking on the image.</p>
								  <p>Measuring <b>O2</b> (Object masks) brings 3 report files: objects areas, <b>CMx</b> and <b>CMy</b> (objects centroids). Tracking results can be visualized from ImageJ macro <b>Tools/OverlayTrackedObjects.ijm</b> by selecting <b>O1</b> as input folder and <b>O2</b> as output folder.</p>
								  <p>To plot some of the measurements, type <b>PlotTrksMeasurements</b> in MATLAB and select the .csv file of the measurement you want to plot. Type the ID of the objects you want to plot.</p>

								  <p><b>Tracking nuclei from a 3D time-lapse</b></p>
								  <p>Segmenting 3D objects from a time-lapse, tracking the objects and exploring the tracks in <b>ImageJ Mastodon</b>.</p>
								  <p>Load project <font color="magenta">'Mastodon3D_Test.mat'</font> and click <b>Run All</b>. To visualize the 3D tracks, an amazing tool is <a href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon" target="_blank">ImageJ Mastodon</a>, leveraging the awesome <a href="https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer" target="_blank">ImageJ Big Data Viewer</a>. To use <b>Mastodon</b>, it is first required to convert the input image to <b>Big Data Viewer</b> format by opening the image in ImageJ, making sure the dimensions are right from Image>Properties (Z and T can sometimes be swapped), and calling <b>Plugins > BigDataViewer > Export Current Image as XML/HDF5</b>. It is recommended to export the image to the same folder as the input image folder and with the default name (<b>export.xml</b>).</p> 
								  
								  <p><b>LOBSTER</b> tracks can be converted to a format importable by <b>Mastodon</b> by typing <b>MamutExport</b> in Matlab console, and selecting the required files/folders: the XML input file should be in <b>Images/Mastodon3D/export.xml</b> and tracking / report folders are respectively <b>O2</b> and <b>R2</b> for this project.</p>
								  
								  <p>Upon conversion, open Mastodon from ImageJ. Click <b>New project</b> in <b>Mastodon</b> window and select the input image XML file (<b>export.xml</b>). Click <b>import mamut</b> and select <b>export_mamut.xml</b>. Click <b>bdv</b> and <b>trackscheme</b> access to the image and track viewers. It is possible to edit the tracks and perform other operations. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> documentation for reference.</p>
								  
								  <p><u>Note</u>: If you want to try Mastodon with object divisions, export the time-lapse from the previous project as XML/HDF5 and perform the same operations.</p>
								  
								  <p><b>Processing large 3D images</b></p>
								  <p>To process large 3D images, bricking should be enabled by defining the variable <b>Brick</b> in the journal. For example, load the project <font color="magenta">'CellPilar_brcks.mat'</font> and inspect the journal (<b>Edit</b>): the variable <b>Brick</b> is set to 128 and the variable <b>GaurdBand</b> is set to 64. Both <b>JENI</b> and <b>IRMA</b> process the image by bricks of size 128 x 128, with an overlap of 64 pixels between bricks.</p>
								  
								  <p>If needed, it is possible to convert bricked output masks to regular masks (folder of image slices) by typing <b>ExportBricksAsSlices</b> in MATLAB console. Select <b>one of the folders</b> (output image) from the output folder (here <b>O1</b>) and an empty folder to export the slices.

                                  	Designing practical journals and becoming familiar with <b>LOBSTER</b> functions can take some practice. To get started, the best approach is probably to test and adapt existing journals since many sample journals and companion images are provided (see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hn9RIoW2sG8nhYN_fLvrPlskLbM0sao7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>LOBSTER</b> documentation</a> <b>Appendix - Applications</b> for the complete list). Here is how you can process:
                                  	<ul>
									<li>Look for a journal performing at least part of the analysis you plan</li>
									<li>Run the journal to see the input images and get a feeling about the results</li>
									<li>Make a copy of the journal and modify it to point to your input image folder (for large images, you probably first want to crop out some illustrative regions)</li>
									<li>Make sure that your images have the same bit depth than the images of the journal, if not optionally convert them.</li>
									<li>Run the journal</li>
									<li>You will probably need to tweak the parameters of some of the function used in the journal to obtain satisfying results. For this, open the journal and edit the parameters as was shown in previous sections. To get help on a function and its parameters, right click its name from MATLAB script editor and select <b>Help on Selection</b></li>
									<li>Completing the project might finally require some customization, such as combining multiple journals and performing cross-measurements or exporting object models (such as illustrated in the previous section)</li>
									</ul>
